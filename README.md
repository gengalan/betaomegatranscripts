# Beta Omega Transcripts

A simple front-end website themed around Beta Theta Pi colors and imagery.  
**Functionality**: Currently, you can upload a PDF transcript to backend, parse transcript, upload to sqlite database, and retrieve information from database.

## Folder Structure

- **index.html** — Main HTML page  
- **style.css** — CSS styling for layout and UI  
- **script.js** — JavaScript for handling PDF upload validation  
- **images/betathetapi-symbol.png** — Placeholder Beta Theta Pi symbol  

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
2. Click on “Choose a PDF file” and pick your transcript (must be `.pdf`).  
3. Click the “Upload” button to simulate an upload.  

## Future Improvements

- [x] Add a back-end to store and process PDF files.
- Determine where to host FastAPI server on
- Create a user login system if privacy/security is needed.  

## Disclaimer

This project uses Beta Theta Pi's name and colors purely for demonstration/educational purposes. It is not an official fraternity website.
